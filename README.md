LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)

Liri is a Javascript Application run in node that allows for users to access information about concerts (when a particular band name is entered) songs (when a particular song name is entered) and movies (when a particular movie name is entered). Liri also showcases how one of these unique tasks (in this case -requesting songs) can be accessed indirectly by accessing information from another document and then responding to it.
